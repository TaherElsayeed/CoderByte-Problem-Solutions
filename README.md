## About
This repository contains the code that I wrote to answer different CoderByte questions. As I am not going to pay for the service, all of the solutions posted here are for the free problems only

---
## Features List
* Contains the code for different CoderByte problems
* Each question solution is located in it's own directory
  * Each directory is titled after the correspondign question name

---
## Installation Instructions
### Requirements
* You'll need Python 3 at the time of writing this README
### How-To Install
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer
2. That's it. There are not other instructions
---
## General Instructions
1. Run the code as you would for any other project. Since all of the solutions have code that launches a function upon opening there should be no worries as to writing custom starter functions
---
## Unsolved Problems
#### All of these problems are from the free problem set:
* Correct Path
* Scale Balancing
* Vowel Square
* Closest Enemy 2
* Questions Marks
* Eight Queens
* Kaprekars Constant
* Chessboard Traveling
* Maximal Square

## Future Features List
* Complete more problems
* Add solutions from other programming languages outside of Python 3
* Add more efficent versions of my responses
* Add more information about the problem in the code or in a problem specific README.md
* Write out a proper proof for Pentagonal Numbers
* Write out a recursive solution for Pentagonal Numbers
