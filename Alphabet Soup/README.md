## About
This is my solution to the Coderbyte Free Challenge *[Alphabet Soup](https://www.coderbyte.com/information/Alphabet%20Soup)*.

The problem goes as such:

*Have the function AlphabetSoup(str) take the str string parameter being passed and return the string with the letters in alphabetical order (ie. hello becomes ehllo). Assume numbers and punctuation symbols will not be included in the string.*

My solution entials converting the inputted string into a list, sorting that list alphabetically, and then combining all of the values into a new string. Then the program returns the new string as the solution to the problem.
